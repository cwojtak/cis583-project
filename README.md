# CIS 583 Project

## Setup
Ensure that you have Docker installed along with the latest NVIDIA driver for your GPU and the latest NVIDIA toolkit
for Docker.
I used https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/wsl-user-guide/index.html and
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/ai/directml/gpu-cuda-in-wsl for reference.
The provided Makefile builds the Docker container using the Dockerfile in the project's root directory.
